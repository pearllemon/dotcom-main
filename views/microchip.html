                <h1>What is a microchip?</h1>
                <div class="top_info">A microchip is a tiny device about the size of a grain of rice that contains a radio frequency specific to each chip. Microchips are usually implanted between the shoulder blades of your pet with a syringe and needle.</div>
                <p>A pet microchip is an intelligent device designed inside a glass enclosure. The enclosure works with your pet's skin tissue in such a way that it's radio frequency is read by universal scanners for the lifetime of your pet. Implanting a microchip is essentially the same as administering a vaccine. Your pet will not be able to feel the microchip once it is inserted.</p>
                <p>Microchips work using radio waves which send out an alpha numeric code to picked up by any universal scanner. A microchip contains a certain radio frequency which is specific to each chip. This numeric code matches your name and contact information in our database so that the radio frequency is used to identify your pet. Typically, all animal shelters, veterinarians and certain police enforcement divisions have a scanner and can use it to easily identify your pet.</p>
